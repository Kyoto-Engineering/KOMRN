      </p>
      <p class="disc">Do not touch the terminal section (charged section) of the Relay or Socket while power is being supplied. Electric shock may occur.</p>
      <p class="disc">Never use a Relay for a load that exceeds the contact ratings of the Relay, such as the switching capacity. Doing so may result in reducing Relay performance for insulation failure, contact welding, and contact faults, and might even result in burning or other damage to the Relay itself.</p>
      <p class="disc">Do not drop the Relay or dismantle it. Doing so may reduce Relay performance and might even result in burning or other damage to the Relay itself.</p>
      <p class="disc">Relay durability is greatly affected by the switching conditions.<br/>Always test the Relay under actual application conditions to confirm applicability and use the Relay only for the number of switching operations that will not affect performance. Continued application of a Relay with reduced performance may result in insulation failure between circuits or in burning in the Relay itself.</p>
      <p class="disc">Do not apply an overvoltage or incorrect voltage to the coil, and do not wire the terminals incorrectly. Incorrect application may prevent the Relay from performing its designed function, may affect external circuits, and may even result in burning or other damage to the Relay itself.</p>
      <p class="disc">Do not use the Relay in atmospheres containing inflammable or explosive gases. Switching arcs or Relay heating may result in fire or explosion.</p>
      <p class="disc">Wire the Relay correctly according to the Precautions for Correct Use when performing wiring or soldering. If the Relay is used with wiring or soldering that is defective, abnormal heating while power is supplied may result in burning.</p>

    <div class="positionleft" style="width:px;">
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">Relay Application</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="disc">Before actually using the Relay, perform all possible tests to confirm applicability. Unexpected trouble can occur in actual operation that would not be anticipated in theoretical planning.</p>
      <p class="disc">Unless otherwise specified, all ratings and performances given in the catalog are for NECA C5442 (JIS C5442) standard test conditions (temperature: 15 to 35&#176;C, humidity: 25% to 75%, pressure: 86 to 106 kPa, altitude: 2,000 m max.). When testing the Relay in the actual application, use the operating environment that will exist in actual applications along with the actual load conditions.</p>
      <p class="disc">All reference data provided in the catalog are from measurement samples taken from production lines and represented in graph form. Actual values will depend on the application.</p>
      <p class="disc">All ratings and performances given in the catalog are from independent tests. Values will vary for different combinations of ratings and performances.</p>

      <p>With DC Relays, the operating voltage fluctuates with the ripple factor and this fluctuation may cause humming. Therefore, a smoothing capacitor C is added to the full-wave rectifying power supply circuit to reduce the ripple factor. Full-wave Rectifying Relays will not produce humming or other problems even on circuits with no smoothing capacitor C. Also, a full-wave rectified 100-V AC power supply can be directly input to a coil with 100-V DC specifications for a Full-wave Rectifying Relay.</p>

      <p>Check the maximum switching capacity on the graph for Relays to select a Relay that suits the application. Use the graphs for maximum switching capacity and durability as a rough guide for selection. The resulting values, however, are only rough guides, so be sure to confirm operation using the actual equipment. A description of how to read the graphs for maximum switching capacity and durability is provided below.<br/>For example, when switching voltage V1 is known, maximum switching current I1 can be obtained from the point of intersection on the characteristic curve. Conversely, maximum switching voltage V1 can be obtained if I1 is known. The number of operations can then be obtained using the Durability Curve from the value obtained for I1.<br/>For a case such as the following:</p>
      <p>If the contact voltage = 40 V, the contact switching current = 2 A<br/>(*1).<br/>The number of operations with a maximum contact voltage of 2 A<br/>is approximately 300,000 (*2).</p>

In the example in the figure above, Wmax. of the higher voltage side*2 (75 W) is lower than W<sub>max</sub>. of the lower voltage side*1 (300 W).<br/>This difference is the amount that switching performance decreases because the contact voltage is high. Applying voltage or current between the contacts exceeding the maximum values will result in the following:</p>
      <p>1. The carbon generated by load switching will accumulate around the contacts and cause deterioration of insulation.<br/>2. Contact deposits and locking will cause contacts to malfunction.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Current applied to contacts when they are open or closed will have a large effect on the contacts. For example, when the load is a motor or a lamp, the larger the inrush current, the greater the amount of contact exhaustion and contact transfer will be, leading to deposits, locking, and other factors causing the contacts to malfunction. (Typical examples illustrating the relationship between load and inrush current are given below.)<br/>If a current greater than the rated current is applied and the load is from a DC power supply, the connection and shorting of arcing contacts will result in the loss of switching capability.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When configuring a sequence circuit, care must be taken to ensure that abnormal operation does not occur due to faults such as sneak current.<br/>The following figure shows an important procedure when a sequence circuit is made. Always have the upper of the two power supply lines be the positive and the lower lines be the negative. (The concept is the same an AC circuit.) Always connect the contact circuit (e.g., Relay contact) to the positive side.</p>
      <div class="img">
        <img src="img/generalry_cn_safetypre_30.gif" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>To the negative side, connect the load circuit, such as a relay coil, timer coil, magnet coil, or solenoid coil.<br/>The following diagram shows an example of sneak current. After contacts A, B, and C are closed causing Relays X1, X2, and X3 to operate, and then contacts B and C are opened, a series circuit is created from A to X1 to X2 to X3. This causes the Relay to hum or to not release.</p>

      <p>If insufficient voltage is applied to the coil, either the Relay will not operate or operation will be unstable. This will cause problems such as a drop in the electrical durability of the contacts and contact welding.<br/>In particular, when a load with a large surge current, such as a large motor, is used, the voltage applied to the coil may drop when a large inrush current occurs to operate the load as the power is turned ON.<br/>Also, if a Relay is operated while the voltage is insufficient, it will cause the Relay to malfunction even at vibration and shock values below the specifications specified in the specification sheets and the catalog. Therefore, be sure to apply the rated voltage to the coil.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Set the power supply voltage fluctuation so that sufficient voltage is supplied to the coils for the Relays to operate completely. If a voltage is applied continuously to a coil that does not enable the Relay to operate completely, the coil may burn due to abnormal heating.<br/>When motors, solenoids, or transformers are connected to the same power lines as those of the power supply of the control circuit of a Relay, the supply voltage to the Relay may drop when these devices operate, causing the Relay to vibrate and the contacts to burn, fuse together, or lose self-held status.<br/>This is particularly likely when a small or small-capacity transformer is connected to the Relay, when the wiring length is too long, or when household or commercial cables small in diameter are used.<br/>If this type of problem occurs, use a synchroscope or other instrument to adjust the voltage fluctuation, and take appropriate countermeasures, such as employing Special Relays having operation characteristics suitable to the environments of your application, and changing the Relay circuit into a DC circuit like the one shown below to absorb the fluctuations in the voltage by using a capacitor.</p>

      <p>The conductor pitch on a PCB is determined by the insulation characteristics between conductors and the environmental conditions under which the PCB is to be used. Refer to the following graph. If the PCB must conform to safety organization standards (such as UL, CSA, or IEC), however, priority must be given to fulfilling their requirements. Also, multi-layer PCBs can be used as a means of increasing the conductor pitch.</p>

      <p>The following table can be used for troubleshooting when Relay operation is not normal. Refer to this table when checking the circuit and other items. If checking the circuit reveals no abnormality, and it appears that the fault is caused by a Relay, contact your OMRON representative. (Do not disassemble the Relay. Doing so will make it impossible to identify the cause of the problem.)<br/>A Relay is composed of various mechanical parts, including a coil, contacts, and iron core. Among these, problems occur most often with the contacts, and next often with the coil.<br/><br/>These problems, however, mostly occur as a result of external factors such as methods and conditions of operation, and can generally be prevented by means of careful consideration before operation and by selecting the correct Relays.<br/>The following table shows the main faults that may occur, their probable causes, and suggested countermeasures to correct them.</p>

        <em class="decimalmark">2.</em>The G9EA and G9EC Relays' contacts have polarity. Be sure to perform connections with the correct polarity. If the contacts are connected with the reverse polarity, the switching characteristics specified in this document cannot be assured.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">3.</em>Do not drop or disassemble this Relay. Not only may the Relay fail to meet the performance specifications, it may also result in damage, electric shock, or burning.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">4.</em>Do not use these Relays in strong magnetic fields of 800 A/m or higher (e.g., near transformers or magnets). The arc discharge that occurs during switching may be bent by the magnetic field, resulting in flashover or insulation faults.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">5.</em>This Relay is a device for switching high DC voltages. If it is used for voltages exceeding the specified range, it may not be possible to interrupt the load and burning may result. In order to prevent fire spreading, use a configuration in which the current load can be interrupted in the event of emergencies.<br/>In order to ensure safety of the system, replace the Relay on a regular basis.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">6.</em>If the Relay is used for no-load switching, the contact resistance may increase and so confirm correct operation under the actual operating conditions.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">7.</em>These Relays contain pressurized gas. Even in applications with low switching frequencies, the ambient temperature and heat caused by arc discharge in the contacts may allow permeation of the sealed gas, resulting in arc interruption failure.<br/>In order to ensure safety of the system, replace Relays on a regular basis.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">8.</em>Do not use or store the Relay in a vacuum. Doing so will accelerate deterioration of the sealing.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">9.</em>With this Relay, if the rated voltage (or current) is continuously applied to the coil and contacts, and then turned OFF and immediately ON again, the coil temperature, and consequently the coil resistance, will be higher than usual. This means that the must operate voltage will also be higher than usual, exceeding the rated value ("hot start"). In this case, take the appropriate countermeasures, such as reducing the load current or restricting the energizing time or ambient operating temperature.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">10.</em>The ripple percentage for DC relays can cause fluctuations in the must-operate voltage or humming. For this reason, reduce the ripple percentage in full-wave rectified power supply circuits by adding a smoothing capacitor. Ensure that the ripple percentage is less than 5%.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">11.</em>Ensure that a voltage exceeding the specified maximum voltage is not continuously applied to the coil. Abnormal heating in the coil may shorten the lifetime of the insulation coating.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">12.</em>Do not use the Relay at a switching voltage or current greater than the specified maximum values. Doing so may result in arc discharge interruption failure or burning due to abnormal heating in the contacts.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">13.</em>The contact ratings are for resistive loads. The electrical endurance with inductive loads is inferior to that of resistive loads.<br/>Confirm correct operation under the actual operating conditions.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">14.</em>Do not use the Relay in locations where water, solvents, chemicals, or oil may come in contact with the case or terminals.<br/>Doing so may result in deterioration of the case resin or abnormal heating due to corrosion or contamination of the terminals. Also, if electrolyte adheres to the output terminals, electrolysis may occur between the output terminals, resulting in corrosion of the terminals or wiring disconnections.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">15.</em>Be sure to turn OFF the power and confirm that there is no residual voltage before replacing the Relay or performing wiring.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">16.</em>The distance between crimp terminals or other conductive parts will be reduced and insulation properties will be lowered if wires are laid in the same direction from the contact terminals. Use insulating coverings, do not wire in the same direction, and take other measures as required to maintain insulation properties.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">17.</em>Use either a varistor, or a diode plus Zener diode as a protective circuit against reverse surge in the relay coil. Using a diode alone will reduce the switching characteristics.</p>
      <p class="decimal">
        <em class="decimalmark">18.</em>Be sure to use the screws provided with the product for wiring coil terminals and contact terminals. The specified tightening torque cannot be achieved with different screws and may result in abnormal heat generation when energized.</p>
