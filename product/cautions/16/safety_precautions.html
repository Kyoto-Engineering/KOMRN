        <strong class="headline2">Relays with Forcibly Guided Contacts</strong>
      </p>
      <p>While the Relay with Forcibly Guided Contacts has the previously described forcibly guided contact structure, it is basically the same as an ordinary relay in other respects. Rather than serving to prevent malfunctions, the forcibly guided contact structure enables another circuit to detect the condition following a contact weld or other malfunction. Accordingly, when a contact weld occurs in a Relay with Forcibly Guided Contacts, depending on the circuit configuration, the power may not be interrupted, leaving the Relay in a potentially dangerous condition (as shown in Fig. 1.)<br/>To configure the power control circuit to securely shut off the power when a contact weld or other malfunction occurs, and to prevent restarting until the problem has been eliminated, add another Relay with Forcibly Guided Contacts or similar Relay in combination to provide redundancy and a failure diagnosis function to the circuit (as shown in Fig. 2).<br/>Refer to the Safety Components Technical Guide.<br/>The G9S/G9SA/G9SB Safety Relay Unit, which combines Relays such as the Relay with Forcibly Guided Contacts in order to provide the above-described functions, is available for this purpose. By connecting a contactor with appropriate input and output to the Safety Relay Unit, the circuit can be equipped with redundancy and a failure diagnosis function.</p>

        <strong class="headline2">Durability of Contact Outputs</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Relay with Forcibly Guided Contact durability depends greatly on the switching condition. Confirm the actual conditions of operation in which the Relay will be used in order to make sure the permissible number of switching operations.<br/>Switching ratings for Relays are generally given for resistive loads and are expressed as the rated voltage and rated current. It is very important that you do not exceed the ratings and allow sufficient leeway when using inductive or capacitive loads.<br/>When the accumulated number of operation exceeds its permissible range, it can cause failure of reset of safety control circuit. In such case, please replace the Relay immediately. If the Relay is used continuously without replacing, then it can lead to loss of safety function.</p>

        <strong class="headline2">CE Marking</strong>
      </p>
      <p>(Source: Guidelines on the Application of Council Directive 2006/95/EC)<br/>The G7SA, G7SB, G7S and G7S-[]-E have been recognized by the VDE for meeting the Low Voltage Directive according to EN requirements for relays and relays with forcibly guided contacts. The Low Voltage Directive, however, contains no clauses that specify handling methods for components, and interpretations vary among test sites and manufacturers. To solve this problem, the European Commission has created guidelines for the application of the Low Voltage Directive in EU. These guidelines present concepts for applying the Low Voltage Directive to components. The G7SA, G7SB, G7S and G7S-[]-E, however, do not display the CE Marking according to the concepts in the guidelines. <br/>However, that does not affect compliance with the Low Voltage Directive and Machine Directive for devices and equipment that use the G7SA, G7SB, G7S or G7S-[]-E. Use the safety standard certificate as documentation to prove standard compliance.</p>

        <strong class="headline2">3.-(1)-1 Load Switching</strong>
      </p>
      <p>In actual Relay operation, the switching capacity, electrical durability,and applicable load will vary greatly with the type of load, the ambient conditions, and the switching conditions. Confirm operation under the actual conditions in which the Relay will be used.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">1) Resistive Loads and Inductive Loads</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The switching power for an inductive load will be lower than the switching power for a resistive load due to the influence of the electromagnetic energy stored in the inductive load.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">2) Switching Voltage (Contact Voltage)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The switching power will be lower with DC loads than it will with AC loads. Applying voltage or current between the contacts exceeding the maximum values will result in the following:</p>
      <p>1.The carbon generated by load switching will accumulate around the contacts and cause deterioration of insulation.</p>
      <p>2.Contact deposits and locking will cause contacts to malfunction.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">3) Switching Current (Contact Current)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Current applied to contacts when they are open or closed will have a large effect on the contacts. For example, when the load is a motor or a lamp, the larger the inrush current, the greater the amount of contact exhaustion and contact transfer will be, leading to deposits,locking, and other factors causing the contacts to malfunction.(Typical examples illustrating the relationship between load and inrush current are given below.)<br/>If a current greater than the rated current is applied and the load is from a DC power supply, the connection and shorting of arcing contacts will result in the loss of switching capability.</p>

      <p>The coil's maximum allowable voltage is determined by the coil temperature increase and the heat withstand temperature of the insulation material. (If the heat withstand temperature is exceeded, it will cause coil burning and layer shorting.) There are also important restrictions imposed to prevent problems such as thermal changes and deterioration of the insulation, damage to other control devices,injury to humans, and fires, so be careful not to exceed the specified values provided in this catalog.</p>

The resistance thermal coefficient of a copper wire is approximately 0.4% per 1&#176;C, and the coil resistance also increases at this percentage.<br/>This catalog values for the must-operate voltage and must-release voltage are given for a coil temperature of 23&#176;C.</p>

      <p>As a rule, power supply waveforms are based on the rectangular (square) waveforms, and do not operate in such a way that the voltage applied to the coil slowly rises and falls. Also, do not use them to detect voltage or current limit values (i.e., using them for turning ON or OFF at the moment a voltage or current limit is reached).<br/>This kind of circuit causes faulty sequence operations. For example,the simultaneous operability of contacts may not be dependable (for multi-pole Relays, time variations must occur in contact operations),and the must-operate voltage varies with each operation. In addition, the operation and release times are lengthened, causing durability to drop and contact welding. Be sure to use an instantaneous ON/OFF.</p>

        <strong class="headline2">3.-(2)-5 Preventing Surges when the Coil Is Turned OFF</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Counter electromotive force generated from a coil when the coil is turned OFF causes damage to semiconductor elements and faulty operation.<br/>As a countermeasure, install surge absorbing circuits at both ends of the coil. When surge absorbing circuits have been installed, the Relay release time will be lengthened, so be sure to check operation using the actual circuits.<br/>External surges must be taken into account for the repetitive peak reverse voltage and the DC reverse voltage, and a diode with sufficient capacity used. Also,ensure that the diode has an average rectified current that is greater than the coil current.<br/>Do not use under conditions in which a surge is included in the power supply, such as when an inductive load is connected in parallel to the coil. Doing so will cause damage to the installed (or built-in) coil surge absorbing diode.</p>

After contacts A, B, and C are closed causing Relays X1, X2, and X3 to operate, and then contacts B and C are opened, a series circuit is created from A to X1 to X2 to X3. This causes the Relay to hum or to not release.</p>

      </p>
      <p>During operation, storage, and transport, avoid direct sunlight and maintain room temperature, humidity, and pressure.</p>
      <p class="disc">If Relays are used or stored for a long period of time in an atmosphere of high temperature and humidity, oxidation and sulphurization films will form on contact surfaces, causing problems such as contact failure.</p>
      <p class="disc">If the ambient temperature is suddenly changed in an atmosphere of high temperature and humidity, condensation will develop inside of the Relay. This condensation may cause insulation failure and deterioration of insulation due to tracking (an electric phenomenon)on the surface of the insulation material.<br/>Also, in an atmosphere of high humidity, with load switching accompanied by a comparatively large arc discharge, a dark green corrosive product may be generated inside of the Relay. To prevent this, it is recommended that Relays be used in at low humidity.</p>
      <p class="disc">If Relays are to be used after having been stored for a long period,first inspect the power transmission before use. Even if Relays are stored without being used at all, contact instability and obstruction may occur due to factors such as chemical changes to contact surfaces, and terminal soldering characteristics may be degraded.</p>

      <p>When mounting a Relay, check this catalog for the specified amount of mounting space for that Relay, and be sure to allow at least that much space.<br/>When two or more Relays are mounted, their interaction may generate excessive heat. In addition, if multiple PCBs with Relays are mounted to a rack, the temperature may rise excessively. When mounting Relays, leave enough space so that heat will not build up,and so that the Relays' ambient temperature remains within the specified operating temperature range.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">(2) Mutual Magnetic Interference</strong>
      </p>
      <p>When two or more Relays are mounted, Relay characteristics may be changed by interference from the magnetic fields generated by the individual Relays. Be sure to conduct tests using the actual devices.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">(1) Noise from Coils</strong>
      </p>
      <p>When the coil is turned OFF, reverse power is generated to both ends of the coil and a noise spike occurs. As a countermeasure,connect a surge absorbing diode. The diagram below shows an example of a circuit for reducing noise propagation.</p>

      </div>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">(2) Noise from Contacts</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Noise may be transmitted to the electronic circuit when switching a load, such as a motor or transistor, that generates a surge at the contacts. When designing patterns, take the following three points into consideration.</p>
      <p>1. Do not place a signal transmission pattern near the contact pattern.</p>
      <p>2. Shorten the length of patterns that may be sources of noise.</p>
      <p>3.Block noise from electronic circuits by means such as constructing ground patterns.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">(3) High-frequency Patterns</strong>
      </p>
      <p>As the manipulated frequency is increased, pattern mutual interference also increases. Therefore, take noise countermeasures into consideration when designing high-frequency pattern and land shapes.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The following table can be used for troubleshooting when Relay operation is not normal. Refer to this table when checking the circuit and other items. If checking the circuit reveals no abnormality, and it appears that the fault is caused by a Relay, contact your OMRON representative. (Do not disassemble the Relay. Doing so will make it impossible to identify the cause of the problem.)<br/>A Relay is composed of various mechanical parts, including a coil,contacts, and iron core. Among these, problems occur most often with the contacts, and next often with the coil.<br/>These problems, however, mostly occur as a result of external factors such as methods and conditions of operation, and can generally be prevented by means of careful consideration before operation and by selecting the correct Relays.<br/>The following table shows the main faults that may occur, their probable causes, and suggested countermeasures to correct them.</p>
