      </p>
      <p>The responsible machine or process designer no longer considers the production requirements and adds safety systems later, but addresses the two issues as a whole. Legislation demands that the machine or process design meets the necessary safety standards and regulations - it is a legal requirement.<br/>Different types of machines will have different levels of associated risk. These risk levels need to be addressed for the whole machine life span. In particular the requirements at commissioning, application/usage and decommissioning of the machine must be considered.<br/>Risk assessment according to ISO14121 is a series of logical steps that enables designers and safety engineers to examine in a systematic way the hazards arising from the use of machinery so that appropriate safety measures can be selected.</p>

These are appropriate during the design, construction, modification, use and decommissioning of the machine.<br/>The safety of machines can be determined in 5 steps.<br/>Documentation of the risk assessment process must be kept.</p>

      <p>Hazard identification means checking for all the hazardous conditions and hazardous events associated with the machine. This involves predicting hazards that may be caused by the machine, such as the following:<br/>Mechanical hazards: Severing, entanglement, crushing, etc.<br/>Electrical hazards: Contact with live parts, static electricity, etc.<br/>Thermal hazards: Health disorders due to contact with high-temperature parts or working in a high-temperature or low-temperature environment</p>

      </p>
      <p>ISO 12100 (-1/-2) has been formed into JIS standard JISB9700 (-1/-2).<br/>The main purpose of this standard is to set out a framework and directions for general machine safety, so that designers can design safe machines.<br/>The introduction of ISO12100-1:2003 states that "The concept of safety of machinery considers the ability of a machine to perform its intended function(s) during its lifecycle where risk has been adequately reduced". The 3-step method, which is an expression of this risk reduction methodology, has been further implemented into the <b>"Risk Reduction Process"</b> illustrated on the following page, but it does not yet seem to have been fully recognized in actual applications. ISO12100-2 sets out examples of various measures, a sample of which are shown below.</p>

      <p>The size of the machine risk is evaluated according to ISO 14121 and measures are taken to reduce the risk. Measures to reduce risk, however, include design measures and mounting safety devices. First, the measures are taken in the design and the category that should be selected is determined by considering two factors: the degree of potential injury (from slight to serious) according to the Category Assessment Table at the right, and the probability of that injury occurring (from almost never to always). The safety category for safety-related parts of control systems in sometimes assessed assigning one category for the entire control circuit of one machine, and in other cases the category is assessed for each part.</p>

        <strong class="headline2">&#9679; Background of ISO 13849-1 Revision</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Until now, the 'category', i.e. the classification of the architecture (structure) of a safety control system, has been a deterministic theory focused on the composition of hardware.<br/>But as technology advances, electronic components such as transistors, integrated circuits and software based components such as microprocessors were adopted as core elements of safety related control systems.<br/>Since year 2000, work has been underway to define the performance of machine safety control systems in terms of function and reliability rather than component failure modes. This is the concept of "functional safety." IEC61508, the international standard for safety related electrical and electronic control systems, provides definitions of safety of complicated controls, down to the constituent components level such as designing reliability including life (until a loss of safety function) and programs based upon probability theory.<br/>IEC61508 has a very wide scope of application, so a new standard specifically designed for the machine control systems, IEC62061, was developed to provide for mechanical safety. However, because this standard basically assumes complicated controls, it assumes many safety control system architectures, and individual architecture requires complicated calculation of probability. This is the reason why IEC62061 was not familiar among machine designers who are accustomed to the relatively easy-to-follow definitions of "Categories."<br/>The latest version of ISO13849-1: 2006 combines the straight forward deterministic features of EN954-1's Categories with IEC62061's probabilistic and systematic design considerations (a reliability model). In other words, the revised version of ISO13849-1 selects the architecture models in IEC62061 that match the definitions of the Categories, and applies those reliability models.<br/>This version can be called a functional safety standard in its simplified version.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">Changes in Risk Estimation Methods</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Both methods require estimating risk of hazards at the risk assessment stages.<br/>In estimating risks, EN954-1 evaluated and classified the results of its risk estimations into the risk levels of I to IV.<br/>But the evaluation process did not encompass any notion of targeted performance that safety measures to reduce risks should reach. As a result, safety control system's structure Categories B to 4 are generally determined directly from the risk graph. When trying to establish a common parameter between persons who perform risk assessment (for example, users) and persons who implement risk reduction (for example, machine designers), the users may not understand the functional differences of safety control system structures from the designer's viewpoint, and the designer in turnfinds it difficult to understand user requirements. Also, the overwhelming majority of risks at actual working sites are minor damage such as suspension of operation for several days, while EN954-1's risk graph gave more stress for risk estimations to serious damage, and the previous standard did not accurately reflect this aspect.</p>
      <div class="img">

      </div>
      <p>The latest revision in ISO 13849-1: 2006 allows users to determine risk estimations homogeneously and uniquely, and makes risk assessment easier for persons responsible for implementing it.</p>

        <strong class="headline2">Change in Definitions of Safety Control System's Performance</strong>
      </p>
      <p>How should designers reduce risks?<br/>If designers are required to satisfy Category requirements only, once determined safety control system structure will maintain the same level of safety performance.<br/>The question is whether or not this is a correct concept considering that every machine can fail at some future time. The components comprising the safety control system also will deteriorate and can fail at some future time. It is important to figure out in what mode the system will encounter a failure at such times. When a machine experiences a failure that causes the expected safety function to fail during a period expected by its users, and if the failure is not detected, it is equal to non performance of safety functions. But, definitions only based upon deterministic theory cannot cover such time related elements.<br/>To improve this aspect, the latest revision includes additional features to the previous structure definitions with two-layer structure definitions that enable users to probabilistically evaluate a safety control system's reliability, including mean time to dangerous failure at the component level and the level of detecting dangerous failure. This allows users to make quantitative evaluation according to how they actually use the machine. This is the core component of the 2006 revision.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The revised standard establishes indicators of a safety control system performance level that can be clearly communicated between a person who implements risk assessment and a person who designs a machine.<br/>These indicators are called Performance Level (hereinafter abbreviated as "PL"), and are evaluated using five levels from "a" to "e." Required performance levels as seen from the standpoint of a person who implements risk assessment are specifically called PLr.<br/>PL, the achieved performance level of a safety control system after risk reduction has been implemented, must be equal to or greater than required Performance Level (PLr).</p>

      </p>
      <p>As with the risk graph in EN954-1, a required performance level is evaluated in terms of severity of injury (S), frequency and/or exposure to hazard (F) and possibility of avoiding hazard or limiting harm (P). As a result, the required performance level (PLr) ranging from "a" to "e" is determined depending on the scale of the risk.</p>

      <p>The Categories refer to the architecture of a safety related control system, and are classified into five categories as defined in the previous version of EN954-1.<br/>MTTFd refers to an average life before the dangerous failure of a component. DC refers to the certainty of detecting failures in the entire system including software. CCF refers to the protection of the entire system from failing due to a common cause. As parameters for reliability, MTTFd and DCavg are determined by formulas, and CCF is determined with a checklist method.<br/>Each of the parameters is classified into levels using standard values: three levels for MTTFd, three levels for DC and two levels for CCF. Performance Levels are evaluated comprehensively in terms of these four parameters.<br/>The following sections show how each of the parameters is calculated.</p>

      </p>
      <p>As described above, when the four parameters are calculated, the PL can be determined from the following graph:</p>
      <p class="disc">Category (the five categories of B, 1, 2, 3, and 4)</p>
      <p class="disc">MTTFd (the three levels of High, Medium, and Low)</p>
      <p class="disc">DCavg (the four levels of High, Medium, Low, and None)</p>
      <p class="disc">CCF (the two levels of 65 or more points and less than 65 points)</p>
      <div class="img">
        <img src="img/safety_tg_functions_36.html" alt="">

      <p>For example, with "Category 4, MTTFd=High, DCavg=High, CCF of 65 points or higher," then the PL is evaluated as "e".

      <p>Safety machinery and equipment consist of a control system and an operative system as shown in <b>Fig. 1 Role of Interlocking Devices</b>. The power control element combines the roles of the control and operative systems, and machine actuators are equipped with safeguards and interlocking devices.<br/>Electricity is supplied to the power control elements only if a safety check signal is sent from the interlock device and an operate command is sent from the control system.<br/>The interlock device is used to send safety check results to the power control elements as shown in the figure below. A safety signal can be sent from a PLC in some cases as long as the PLC does not have a negative impact on the interlock device.<br/>In other words, the interlock device (safety-related part) and the PLC (non safety-related part) are completely independent of each other.<br/>Control systems are divided into safety-related and non-safety-related parts in international safety standards, and they must be constructed so that non-safety-related parts do not have a negative impact on safety-related parts during normal operation or when a malfunction occurs.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">When a worker is using a hand-held console with operation switches to teach a robot, retool, or perform maintenance, unexpected movement of a hazard can result in a hazardous state. When this occurs, it's impossible to predict whether the operator will instinctively release the console or will grip it with force. A normal switch thus does not turn OFF when excessive force is applied, which may result in a worker accident.<br/>With an Enabling Switch, machines or robots can be controlled only when the switch is gripped lightly to the middle position. If the switch is gripped with force past the middle position or if the switch is released, the machine or robot will be shut OFF, disabling operation.</strong>

        <strong class="headline2">Enabling Switches are normally used built into teaching pendants, grip switches, and other hand-held controls. They can be combined with safety circuits built with Safety Relay Units and other devices to ensure safety.</strong>

        <strong class="headline2">Until recently, there were no means to confirm the safety of technologies such as complex electronic components or software, which made it difficult to apply them safely. Demands have increased, however, by companies that want greater safety in the use of various devices.This has led to the concept of functional safety, which is a method of confirming safety by providing the reliability that electronic equipment and programmable devices used in safety equipment will operate properly when the safety related demand is given. Reliability here refers to "lowering human risk to the level of socially tolerable risk." This includes the following factors:</strong>

      <p>IEC 61508, which was issued in 1998, is representative of common standards for functional safety. IEC 61508 is further divided into seven detailed standards for individual fields of application. Standards for industrial machinery are stipulated in IEC 62061. For detailed information, refer to these standards.<br/>In the above standards, the SIL (Safety Integrity Level) is defined as parameters that specify the requirements of safety functions. In the area of machinery, it has been decided to coordinate the SIL with the performance level (PL) defined by ISO 13849-1,2006.<br/>(Extracted from the NECA Safety Guide Handbook.)</p>
