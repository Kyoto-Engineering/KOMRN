      </p>
      <p>Control systems that affect safety must be designed to minimize the possibility of danger occurring even when there is a failure in an interlocking device. Safety devices are equipped with functions such as a direct opening action for switches and a forcibly guided mechanism for relays, as required by standards. These functions are designed to operate correctly within the control system in which they are used.</p>
      <p>The following describes safety components that are commonly used to develop safety functions.</p>

        <strong class="headline2">1) Guard Monitoring and Interlocking</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Guard monitoring and interlocking switches are one of the most important types of protective devices to prevent dangerous situations by shutting power off from the machine.<br/><br/>When it is decided to protect the machine with fences, we must be sure that the only way inside the dangerous area is through the guard. If the guard is opened, a mechanically actuated position detector stops the machine. Every guard must have position detector switches to ensure the safety of personnel. A basic requirement is that if the door is opened, the machine must stop before anyone can reach the hazardous moving parts of the machine.<br/><br/>The most import selection criteria of an interlocking device are:</p>
      <p>&#8226; the conditions of use and intended use (ISO 12100)<br/>&#8226; the hazard present at the machine (ISO 12100)<br/>&#8226; the severity of the possible harm<br/>&#8226; the probability of failure of the interlocking device<br/>&#8226; stopping time and access time considerations<br/>&#8226; the frequency of access<br/>&#8226; the duration of person&#8217;s exposure to the hazard<br/>&#8226; performance considerations</p>
      <p>The position switch shall be actuated in positive mode (for more details, refer to the section "Negative operation and Positive operation"). The break contact of the position switch shall be of the "direct opening action" type. (IEC60947-5-1)<br/><br/>The security of an interlock switch is dependent on its ability to withstand attempts to "cheat" or defeat the mechanism. An interlock switch should be designed so that is cannot be defeated in a simple manner. "Defeating in a simple manner" is an illegal nullification by measures other than valid mode changing procedure using an operating switch etc. For example, the following readily available objects can be used as a defeating tool:</p>
      <p>&#8226; screws, needles, sheet-metal pieces;<br/>&#8226; objects in daily use such as keys, coins, tools required for the intended use of the machine</p>

        <strong class="headline2">2) Standards for guard interlock switches (ISO 14119)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>ISO 14119 "Interlocking devices associated with guards" provides the designing standards for interlocking devices. To design interlocking switches and interlocking circuits, ISO 13849-1 must be conformed.</p>

        <strong class="headline2">3) Requirements for Guard Monitoring</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Interlocking guards must ensure that the safety door protects the hazardous area as defined in ISO 12100.<br/>The sensors and the signal processing must comply with all required norms and directives.</p>
      <p>&#8226; Switches shall be designed to withstand all expected and foreseeable stresses<br/>&#8226; Switches shall comply with safety standards, especially, direct opening action and safety door switches shall be completely equipped.<br/>&#8226; The principles of redundancy and diversity shall be considered in the mechanical design of switches and signal processing, if necessary.<br/>&#8226; Safety-related parts in the associated control circuit must meet at least the required level (PLr) defined in the risk assessment.</p>

        <strong class="headline2">4) Requirements for Guard Locking</strong>
      </p>
      <p>An interlocking device with a guard locking shall be used when the stopping time is greater than the access time taken by a person to reach the danger zone.<br/><br/>The interlocking device with a guard locking is intended to lock a guard in the closed position and linked to a control system so that:</p>
      <p>&#8226; the machine cannot operate until the guard is closed and locked;<br/>&#8226; the guard remains locked until the risk has passed.</p>
      <p>For applications requiring frequent access, the interlocking device shall be chosen to provide the least possible hindrance to the operation of the guard.<br/><br/>Because the guard might be defeated, requirements of intended use, conditions of use, risk assessment and stopping time and access time must be taken into account. In some cases to reduce the frequency of guard opening/closing, the machine processes must be reviewed.</p>

      <p>1. Cam operated actuation</p>
      <p>When one single safety switch is used it shall be installed to actuate in positive mode to prevent the safety switch from being defeated in a simple manner. A higher level safety protection against defeat can be achieved, e.g., by enclosing the cam and safety switch in the same housing.</p>

      <p>2. Tongue-actuated operation</p>
      <p>The tongue-actuated operation switch requires a dedicated tongue and can prevent easy cheating of the switch.<br/>However care should be taken because it can be defeated by using a spare tongue.</p>

      <p>3. Hinge operated actuation</p>
      <p>Hinged door switches have two features. One is that it is difficult to defeat the switch. The other is that it can be used for small size guards thanks to no limitation to tongue radius as opposed to operation key operated switches. Prior confirmation is required for very large wide guard doors because a significant gap may be generated when the opening of the door is detected.</p>

  <div class="column1">
    <div class="positionleft" style="width:px;">
      <p>4. Actuation by non-contact method</p>
      <p>Non-contact door switches require a dedicated actuator for sensor parts and can prevent the switches from being easily defeated.<br/>These switches do not utilize the mechanical operating method as opposed to the cam operated and/or tongue-actuated switches. As a result, they are unlikely to suffer from the mounting limitation compared to the other switches because of the easy positioning during installation.</p>

IEC 61496-1 stipulates exactly how type 4 sensor will ensure safety for an accumulation of up to three faults. In the safety light curtain safety was designed in by using dual CPUs that check each other as well as by using redundant signal processing and output circuits.

      <p>4. Muting Function (IEC 61496-1)</p>
      <p>The muting function temporarily stops the detection function of the Safety Light Curtain and automatically keeps it ON regardless of whether the light is incident or tripped.<br/>The muting function can be added to the F3SJ-A/B Safety Light Curtain by attaching a key cap for muting. The F3SG-RA Safety Light Curtain provides this function as standard.<br/>Conventionally when objects such as AGVs or transport pallets passed through the detection area, the work process was stopped by tripping of the Safety Light Curtain each time they passed. With the addition of the muting function, the safety output can be turned OFF only when a person enters the area, while automatically maintaining the safety output when a workpiece passes through. This makes it possible for work to continue without stopping the production line.<br/>However, when muted, the safety detection function is deactivated, which means that it cannot output an OFF signal to the hazard when a person enters the detection area.<br/>Therefore various conditions exist for the methods to install and/or control muting sensors.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Safety Controllers receive signals from a safety input device, control whether the machine should be started or not, and notify each device of their determination. They can be broadly categorized into the following four types:</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="column1">
    <div class="positionleft" style="width:px;">
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">(1) Safety Relay Unit</strong>
      </p>
      <p>A typical configuration for the operation control of machinery and equipment is shown in Fig. 1. This is a safety-relay-based control device and suited to single input/single output applications.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">&#8226; Non-safety-related Parts</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The role of non-safety-related parts is to start and continue the operation of devices upon receiving an operate command signal from an automatic control system.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">&#8226; Safety-related Parts</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The role of safety-related parts is to enable operation only when the safety of the machinery and equipment is confirmed.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">&#8226; Processing</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The processing sends an operate signal to a power control element only when it has processed that both the abovementioned operate command signal, which is sent from a nonsafety-related part, and the safety check signal from a safetyrelated part, which confirms the safety of the machinery, allow operation.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">&#8226; Processing Elements</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The processing element cannot be created by simply combining multiple elements.<br/>Its circuit must incorporate elements that will minimize risks caused by a failure in machinery or equipment. These circuit configuration elements typically include items (1) to (5) shown below.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">&#8226; Necessity of Safety Relay Units</strong>
      </p>
      <p>It is possible to configure a safety-verified circuit by incorporating safety relays with forcibly guided contacts.<br/>However, this requires a certain level of technology to configure the circuit and some expense for its certification. As a result, it has become general practice to use standard units that specialized manufacturers have developed by incorporating safety relays. These are provided as a series of Safety Relay Units with proven functional safety.</p>

      <p>Electronic units are suited to simple relay sequence configurations for single input/single output applications. In addition the following techniques have been used to handle complicated applications (with multiple inputs and outputs) that are difficult for simple relay sequences.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">&#8226; Dual CPUs</strong>
      </p>
      <p>We pursued safety to the limit to deliver safety and reliability backed by the highest level of safety design and FMEA. Two CPU Units perform mutual checking and diagnostic monitoring of each I/O section, and the safety of operations is further verified by FMEA and process-controlled design and production.</p>

      <p>For example, when partially stopping each module of a device as well as stopping the entire device are required, they can be achieved by making the AND logic into a function. The logic connection function allows them to be easily achieved and enables flexible response to applications.</p>
      <p>&#8226; When the Emergency Stop Switch is pressed, the entire machine will stop.<br/>&#8226; When a door is open, the corresponding part will not activate.</p>

      </p>
      <p>By creating safety programs, the designer can more flexibly handle complex applications.<br/>There are, however, some requirements for safety in programming safety circuits.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">1) Preventing User Programming Errors</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Safety functions (such as emergency stop buttons and two-hand operating buttons) are provided as verified function blocks to ensure safety at the function block level.<br/>The verification and validation are necessary in addition to the confirmation of the safety of the combination of function blocks to demonstrate final safety as an machinery control system.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">2) Preventing Unintended Operation from Incorrect Wiring</strong>
      </p>
      <p>External wiring faults are detected, including incorrect wiring, ground faults, short circuits, and disconnection. Internal circuit faults are also detected.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">3) Preventing Unintended Settings</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Checks are performed to ensure that the parameters input by the user are correctly transferred to and set in the devices before automatically enabling starting.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">4) Preventing System Access Except by Administrators</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Passwords are set for devices to allow only administrators to change parameters, operating modes, or others aspects of operation.<br/>When designing the safety-related parts, such as equipment and devices, with the programmable safety device, safety validity for software must also be checked.</p>

        <strong class="headline2">Networking</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Creating networks for safety circuits enables applications that require distributing safety devices, as well as expansion of I/O capacity.<br/>The following four measures are taken in implementing safety circuit networks.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">(1) Checking Communications Data (System Redundancy)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Redundancy is implemented for safety data by sending inverted data together with safety data and checking response messages sent from destinations to improve safety.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">(2) Special Check Code for Safety Data (Safety-CRC)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Check codes called Safety-CRC are attached to the safety data to ensure that any message corruption and/or impersonation are detected.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">(3) IDs for Transmitters and Receivers</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Mutually monitoring safety devices' unique ID code and/or implementing an unique ID code into the transferred data prevent data communications between incorrect devices.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="headline2">(4) Data Time Management</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Reversed or late communications data are monitored by attaching time stamps by the safety devices to data they send and/or detecting the data reception time by destination nodes of transferred data.</p>

        <strong class="headline2">(3) Enabling Switches</strong>
      </p>
      <p>An enabling switch is a safety component used so that various hazards such as inadvertent entanglement can be avoided or reduced when performing non-scheduled maintenance work or other non-scheduled operations in hazardous areas, such as those inside safety fences.<br/><br/>When an operator is using a hand-held console with operation switches to teach a robot, retool, or perform maintenance, unexpected movement of a hazard and/or operator's inadvertent behaviors can result in a hazardous state. In a such situation, it's impossible to predict whether the operator will instinctively release the console or will grip it with force.<br/><br/>A normal switch thus does not turn OFF when excessive force is applied, which may result in an operator accident. With an Enabling Switch, machines or robots can be controlled only when the switch is gripped lightly to the middle position. If the switch is gripped with force past the middle position or if the switch is released, the machine or robot will be shut OFF, disabling operation.<br/><br/>Enabling Switches are normally used built into teaching pendants, grip switches, and other hand-held controls. They can be combined with safety circuits built with Safety Relay Units and other devices to ensure safety.</p>

      <p>The safety functions for drive devices are defined in IEC 61800-5-2. The following figure shows the range of the safety-related parts (PDS (SR)) of the electric-power drive systems.</p>

      </p>
      <p>STO (Safe Torque Off) function, which is a typical safety function, is explained here.<br/>As shown in the following figure, STO cuts off the power, which generates turning forces (thrust) of the motor, from the motor.<br/>In STO additional measures, such as mechanical brakes, may be required because the stop state is not controlled. In addition, when a driver/motor should be accessed for maintenance and others, disconnection from the power source using devices such as breaker and contactor is required because STO does not have an electric-shock prevention function.</p>
